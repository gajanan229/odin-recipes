    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, grated (about 1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>2 pounds flank steak, trimmed</li>
        <li>1 large onion (about 13 3/8 ounces), cut into thin slices</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) bottle beer (such as Yuengling Lager)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>8 small whole-wheat hoagie rolls, split and toasted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Stir together the olive oil, brown sugar, salt, cumin, paprika, pepper, and 
    garlic, forming a paste; rub the paste into both sides of the steak, using 
    all of the mixture. Place the onion slices in a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker; 
    top with the steak. Pour the beer and soy sauce over the steak. Add the 
    bay leaf and thyme. Cover and cook on LOW until the steak is tender, 7 
    to 8 hours.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Transfer the steak and onions to a platter, reserving the cooking liquid in 
        the slow cooker; cover the steak and onions with aluminum foil to keep 
        warm.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Pour the reserved cooking liquid through a wire-mesh strainer into a 
        medium saucepan, discarding the solids. Bring to a boil over high, and 
        boil until the sauce is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, about 12 minutes. Stir 
        together the cornstarch and water in a small bowl; drizzle into the sauce, 
        and whisk until blended. Reduce the heat to medium-high, and simmer, 
        stirring often, until thickened, about 1 minute. Shred the steak with 2 
        forks. Divide the steak and onions among the toasted rolls. Pour the 
        sauce into dipping bowls, and serve with the sandwiches.</p>
